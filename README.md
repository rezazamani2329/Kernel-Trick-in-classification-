# Kernel-Trick-in-classification
## I define linear regression and regression with kernel trick which shows efficiency of kernel trick 
## I define logistic regression, decision trees and KNN classifiers 
## I check decision boundaries for all mentioned classifiers in two options:
### 1- using linear kernel 
### 2- uisng polynomial kernel
## I check the score and also score report for all classifiers
